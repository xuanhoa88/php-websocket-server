/*
	Example Chatbox Script
	 - Uses WebSocket for client and server communication
	 - Works with: ws api.php
	
	Starting the server
	 - Open any browser and visit server.php once (this file). For example: http://127.0.0.1/chatbox/server.php
	   The page should appear to "never load", this is supposed to happen and means the server is running.
	
	Connecting to the chatbox
	 - Open Firefox 6 and visit index.html. For example: http://127.0.0.1/chatbox/
	 - Type a username into the top right box, and press the connect button.
	   You should now be able to send messages, receive messages, and see a list of connected users.
	
	Protocol
	 - This example chatbox script uses a very basic text protocol.
	
	Client -> Server:
		JOIN username
		QUIT
		TEXT text here
	
	Server -> Client:
		ONJOIN username
		ONQUIT username
		ONTEXT username text here
		USERS username1 username2
		SERVER text here
	
	USERS sends a list of space-separated usernames to a client when that client has joined.
	SERVER sends text to a client that is not chat text, for example: Username already taken
	QUIT does not need to take a username because the server stores usernames for clients in $users.
